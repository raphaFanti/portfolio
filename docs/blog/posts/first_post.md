# Hello world, this is my first portfolio!

A new chapter in life is the opportunity to become closer to the person we wish to be and to do  the things we wanted to do. Hence here is my portfolio and blog, a place to talk about my technical passions and showcase my interests via projects. Happy reading!

<!-- more -->

## Featured projects

A [selection of projects](/portfolio/), cured to showcase some of the most interesting technologies / findings I had the opportunity to lear or work with

## Projects by topic

Here it is possible to see [all the projects](/portfolio/projects) I have worked on, tagged by their main categories

## Blog

Under the blog session I hope to talk about smaller analysis and other topics where a full blown project does not make sense.

## About me

I also created a [simple page](/portfolio/about) telling more about how I came to be interested in Engineering and the many other technical passions that I gravitate around.

## Hosted in Github pages, with love

For this portfolio I wanted something technical, easy to use and version manageable. I heard of MK Docs for documenting, and researching about it, albeit not many portfolios have been done with it, I decided to give it a try.

The [Material extension](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) was a pleasure to setup and use, and using markdown to create content is super fast!

I also learned how to deploy to [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), a free and super recommended place for developers' portfolios.
