    ## Can machine learning predict the next hotspots for climbing gyms?
    
	Spoiler alert: it can do it much better than Excel! We have used advanced scrapping and machine learning to identify where will the Climbing market boom next.

    ### Building a huge CNC machine during pandemics to realize a child's dream
    
	Lots of time and energy to spend: it was time to build the machine that got me interested in Engineering. Lots of fun building and learning new skills, such as welding.

    ### Taking skiing analytics to the next level - BLE connection to Suunto watches
    
	Bluetooth low energy at what it does best: small device connectivity and unleashing analytics potential in sports. In this project we have connected a ski touring logger to a Suunto watch.

    ### Is AI better than a person in classifying sport activities in Strava?
    
	Looking at an activity simple statistics (time elapsed, average speed, altitude gain / loss) we tried to measure effectiveness of classification algorithms to identify paragliding activies in Strava
